Letâ€™s turn your **Task Manager** into a step-by-step **OOP learning roadmap** ðŸš€

Weâ€™ll start simple, then gradually layer in OOP concepts, so you *feel* why OOP is useful.

# ðŸ—‚ Roadmap: Task Manager in Python (OOP Journey)

---

## **Step 1 â€“ Basic Classes & Encapsulation**

* Create a `Task` class (with title, description, completed flag).
* Create a `TaskManager` class to store tasks.
* Encapsulate logic: `Task` knows how to mark itself complete.

âœ… You already have this working!

---

## **Step 2 â€“ Add Attributes & Methods**

* Add new fields like **priority** and **due\_date**.
* Implement methods in `Task`:

  * `is_overdue()` (compares due date with today).
  * `__str__()` returns readable task info.

ðŸ‘‰ Youâ€™ll see how adding functionality is cleaner in OOP than in procedural code.

---

## **Step 3 â€“ Inheritance**

* Create subclasses of `Task`:

  * `WorkTask` (maybe add a `project` field).
  * `PersonalTask` (maybe add a `location` field).
* Override `__str__()` so each type prints differently.

ðŸ‘‰ Learn how inheritance avoids duplication.

---

## **Step 4 â€“ Polymorphism**

* Suppose both `WorkTask` and `PersonalTask` override `remind()`.

  * `WorkTask.remind()` â†’ "Reminder: submit report to boss."
  * `PersonalTask.remind()` â†’ "Reminder: buy groceries."
* When you loop over tasks, you just call `task.remind()` and Python decides which version to use.

ðŸ‘‰ This is **polymorphism** in action.

---

## **Step 5 â€“ Persistence (Saving & Loading)**

* Add methods in `TaskManager` to:

  * Save tasks to a **JSON file**.
  * Load tasks back on program start.
* Decide how to handle subclasses when reloading (e.g., store `"type": "WorkTask"` in JSON).

ðŸ‘‰ Youâ€™ll practice abstraction and serialization.

---

## **Step 6 â€“ Exceptions & Validation**

* Add error handling in `TaskManager`:

  * Prevent adding tasks with empty titles.
  * Handle invalid indexes in `complete_task()`.
  * Raise custom exceptions like `TaskNotFoundError`.

ðŸ‘‰ Youâ€™ll see how OOP makes error handling more structured.

---

## **Step 7 â€“ User Interface Layer**

* Build a **CLI menu**:

  * `1. Add task`
  * `2. List tasks`
  * `3. Complete task`
  * `4. Save & Exit`
* Separate UI logic from business logic.

ðŸ‘‰ This teaches **separation of concerns**.

---

## **Step 8 â€“ Advanced Features (Optional)**

* Add a `Category` class (many tasks can belong to a category).
* Add filtering (show only completed, only overdue, etc.).
* Export to CSV.
* Add unit tests (`pytest`) to test your classes.

ðŸ‘‰ This takes it closer to a **real-world app**.

---

ðŸ’¡ By the end, youâ€™ll have a **mini productivity tool**, built step by step, each stage introducing a new OOP principle.
